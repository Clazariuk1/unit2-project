<h3>Unit Testing instructions</h3>
<p>After successfully cloning and opening the repository into your desired folder location, open the project within VS Code by typing 'code .'
<br>
Necessary packages to install: npm i -D nodemon jest supertest artillery mongo-db-memory-server (npm i quick shortcut))
<br>
open up the terminal in the open project and type 'npm run test' after verifying you're in the project folder.
The tests created in ./tests/within user.test.js will execute and return the corresponding results.
<br>
To perform load testing, type 'clear' in terminal to freshen your page and then type 'npm run load' to initiate artillery load testing.
</p>

<br>
<h3>Load Testing Instructions</h3>
<p>After successfully cloning and opening the respository, open up the terminal in the project folder and type 'npm run load'. The load tests created in ./artillery.yml will execute and return the corresponding results.</p>
